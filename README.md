Thank you for reading and have a wonderful rest of your day!  
The banking will reset upon exiting and reopening the game...  
That's what I call above my paygrade... So, some stuff I can't do, however this works!

Town was my favorite and the nostalgia is what keeps bringing me back...  
I made this because I was bored and had some time to spare...  
Yes, I did not code any of this however I heavily modified some stuff with AI.  
Took a lot of troubleshooting and trial and error. Kept running into error, after error, after error...  
Then everything just randomly started to work... So I didn‚Äôt question it and kept working along.  
Yes, I renamed all the files because I have OCD and wanted them to all be named similarly.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The following were custom made via AI:

- üî• NO FIRE DAMAGE (TOGGLE ON/OFF RIGHT ON D-PAD)  
- üéØ CHOOSE A STARTING WEAPON (MINIMAL SELECTION FOR TESTING)  
- üé∞ GAMBLING IN THE BAR AT TOWN (COSTS 500 POINTS A SPIN; WIN OR RISK IT ALL)  
- üëã A SIMPLE WELCOME MESSAGE UPON STARTING... NOTHING MUCH...

---

As for `[IMPORTANT] PLUTONIUM FIX.gsc` ‚Äî I cannot remember when and where I got that...  
All I know is that it fixes the spawn rates. I got that a few years back when I first downloaded Plutonium.  
If I remember where I found it I'll credit the author ‚Äî I just really can‚Äôt remember.

As for `ranked.gsc` and `_clientids.gsc` ‚Äî as far as I‚Äôm aware, that‚Äôs needed to make everything work...  
I went into this blind. I got super stoned and worked on this with the help of **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** specifically. Overall, this took me over a week to setup... AI is very fast... My end goal is just to play the game lol...

So for the record:  
I am **not claiming** that I coded any of this at all.  
I simply got it made with AI and now I want to release it.  
In case others may be interested and/or potentially want to improve on it.  
This way it‚Äôs like a fully premade setup for Town.  
Enable the mod for all weapons on all maps... 
Backup your current images and scripts setup...
Remove your images and scripts folder and replace it with this one found on github. 
**Remember to make backups** along the way ‚Äî I‚Äôve made that mistake of forgetting many times...

---

Once again, only posting this for those who care.  
And if you don‚Äôt care, please feel free to move along ‚Äî it‚Äôs all good.  
Just uploading this in case anyone actually wants it...

I‚Äôm trying my hardest to give credit where credit is due...  
If I left anyone out, please let me know and I‚Äôll update this.  
I love this game and just wanted to dedicate some of my time to make something with AI for it.  
This is me using my time to give back to the game ‚Äî maybe someone will find this and be like:  
**"Damn, I actually wanted that."**

---

**For those who care ‚Äî you're welcome.**
